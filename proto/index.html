It is even becoming difficult to sell the TV game that is just good or marginal. And this trend is irreversible. The number of manufacturers will decrease – and so will the number of new games. But we will enter a new generation of TV or similar games. They will inevitably stimulate renewed interest, enthusiasm, and earnings."

                        <p class="margin-txt">"A brief, cautionary word. Despite the variety of electronic games available, some industry observers are convinced the future lies not with limited option dedicated games, but with programmable systems that can be expanded indefinitely. Only Fairchild has such a game on the market today, but others are near. It may pay to wait. RCA, for example, will have its “Studio II” ready by mid-year. It promises five built-in games with three cartridges available initially and others to follow. <br/> <br/>
                        A programmable video unit, with its ability to create virtually any imaginable kind of visual display, has the potential to offer much more than just entertainment. It could be the first step toward a true home computer, useful as an instructional tool and as an information storage and retrieval device. As these applications are refined, the price of new program cartridges should drop, perhaps by as much as 50 per cent. <br/> <br/>
                        All this, of course, still is some time away. Meanwhile, there are plenty of electronic games with which to occupy our leisure time. Television anyone?" <span class="citation">Roger Verhulst, Chicago Tribune 1977.</span></p>

                        <p class="margin-txt">The sale of home TV electronic games peaked during the Christmas season of 1976, followed by a severe decline in 1977. Was the estimated 3-million video games sold in ’76 just a passing fancy of the American public? Obviously not, since manufacturers are now producing with the expectation that 1977 sales will easily be twice those of 1976. And nonvideo electronic games will certainly make their mark this year, too. Home TV games did not move as well as anticipated during the first half of ’77 for a variety of reasons: (1) Christmas doesn’t last all year (though interest in games should be year-round); (2) reduced selling prices on games disheartened many retailers, who placed them on the back shelves; (3) programmable games are just around the corner. Concerning the latter, there are two companies already marketing them — Fairchild, who can’t seem to keep up with consumer demands at $170 a game [system] plus “cartridges,” and RCA, just really entering the market with a $150 programmable model.<span class="citation">Arthur P.

                <div class="article-txt">
                    <p>In 1977 the home video game industry collapsed. A year earlier sixty or seventy companies had been manufacturing over two-hundred video game consoles. They had made $150 million in profits on sales of 3.5 million units. Atari release a home version of their arcade Pong game in 1975 and the next year the home game industry had grown 10&ndash;fold. But in 1977, those profits vanished. Everyone that had scrambled to get in the game in 1976 ceased production or went bankrupt. <img class="margin-link" id="enthusiasm-and-earnings"></p>
                    <p>The cause of the bust was also the cause of the boom: the AY-3-8500, a microchip that allowed manufacturers to cheaply manufacture Pong clones. Everyone wanted to cash in on Atari's home Pong success and rushed into the market with Pong clones. Within two years of the chip's release the market was saturated with  knock-offs. Every Pong clone was the same, so consumers had no reason to buy new consoles and demand fell. The price of the chips also fell, so a company that bought thousands of AY-3-8500's for a few bucks each would be undercut a few months later by a company that bought the same chip for a few cents. Then Fairchild Semiconductor released their cartridge&ndash;based system that could play infinitely many more games than the Pong machines, the Pong market collapsed. <img class="margin-link" id="electronic-games-peaked"></p>
                    <p>Only a few companies survived by following Fairchild's lead with their own programmable systems: Bally, Magnavox, Coleco, and Atari. <img class="margin-link" id="television-anyone"></p>
                    <p>Few had seen this crash coming. One was Jack Tramiel <img class="bio-link" id="jack-tramiel">, the irascible, unscrupulous founder of Commodore. Tramiel was the kind of businessman who would refuse to pay his bills until the companies he owed went bankrupt and then he could buy them out. He called his business philosophy &ldquo;The Religion&rdquo;. In 1972 Commodore almost fell when the calculator market crashed. The 1972 and 1977 crashes had the same calculus: lots of new competitors, falling component prices, and little market differentiation or innovation. At the time, Commodore had been buying chips from Texas Instruments. TI decided to cut Commodore and other customers out with their own calculators. Texas Instrument's move cost Commodore millions of dollars and Tramiel took it personally. He could hold a grudge deeper and longer than almost anyone, and privately sought to destroy TI. He started by steering his company into computers, but stayed out of the video game boom. He knew a boom/bust market as well as anyone. He would bide his time.</p>
                    <p>Nolan Bushnell <img class="bio-link" id="nolan-bushnell">, founder and CEO of Atari, knew that to keep his company alive he would have to lead the market with new products. In 1975 when sales of arcade Pong machines dried up, he created home Pong. Atari had to stay ahead of the crashing wave of technology again. Atari's business strategy was shaped by the Crash of '77. They needed their own programmable system which could be a platform for selling unlimited, variable games. Such a system would have a narrow profit margin in order to realize a greater sales of games &mdash; the Gillette razor strategy. As long as Atari could keep making and selling new games, they could keep demand high.</p>
                    <p>That strategy could have worked. </p>

                    <p>Nolan Bushnell, always the entrepreneur, knew Atari had to pivot and create an affordable cartridge-based home console of their own or perish in the approaching collapse. He assigned the project to Al Alcorn, the original Pong engineer and Atari co-founder. Atari hired some very talented engineers and started work on Stella, later named the Video Computer System, and later named the 2600.</p>
                    <blockquote class="quote right-quote">"Every year we risked the whole company on new products. If the VCS had failed, or Home Pong had burned up, we'd have killed the company." &mdash; Al Alcorn </blockquote>
                    <p>But Atari had no money to manufacture the system, let alone finish the engineering and design. The company had been operating without large cash investment on a steady, but small stream of revenue. Every new game was an all-or-nothing proposition. "There wasn't a pool of capital," remembers Steve Bristow. "There were times when it was practically cheque-to-cheque and there would be a race out of the parking lot to make sure your pay cheque would be cashed." Atari had to get capital fast because Pong was over. Worse, Fairchild Semiconductor had released a programmable home system called the Channel F. The $170 Fairchild Channel F could play an unlimited number of games programmed on interchangeable cartridges &mdash; just like Stella. Atari was going to be left behind and this was unacceptable to Bushnell.</p>
                    <p>They had a two choices: go public or sell themselves. They chose the latter.</p>
                    <p>Atari looked around for buyers for several months before they were approached by Warner Communications, known for their feature films like Jaws and The Godfather and music publishing. Warner CEO Steve Ross, like Bushnell, was always looking ahead trying to shift his company into new industries. Ross figured he couldn't sell Fleetwood Mac records forever. Atari was an opportunity for Warner to pioneer a new entertainment industry with few competitors.</p>

                        "Nolan Bushnell can look you in the eye when he says he was twenty-nine years old when he started Atari with $250 of his own money and in four years had sold the company for $28 million, of which $15 million went into his pocket." – Scott Cohen
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>In October 1976 Warner bought Atari for $28 million dollars, making Nolan Bushnell an overnight millionaire and securing the funding Atari needed to manufacture and market the Video Computer System, and put one in the home of every kid in America. In 1977 Warner invested $100 million into the VCS.</p>
                    <p>With Warner's investment and marketing know-how Atari would grow at an unimaginable pace doubling in size every year. It became the fastest growing company in American history going from 3 employees in 1972 to over 12,000 in 1982. By 1982 Atari would account for 60% of Warner revenues. By the numbers it looked like a great deal for everyone, especially Warner.</p>

                    <p>Atari struggled to sell its VCS. After Christmas of 1977, 400,000 units remained in Atari warehouses. Bushnell already started planning for Atari's next big product, a holographic system called Cosmos.</p>
                    <p>Warner thought that Atari needed more than just a new system. It needed an executive who could whip the company into shape, so Manny Gerrard hired Ray Kassar to turn things around in February of 1978. </p>
                    <p>Kassar had a marketing background in the textile industry and Gerrard figured a hard boiled, East Coast, salesman  in a three piece suit could whip Atari into shape and find a way to sell those VCS consoles. Kassar started by switching to a year-round marketing and sales effort instead of just Christmas, but that did little to motivate buyers. </p>
                    <p>Kassar streamlined operations and cut R&amp;D. He didn't understand why all this money was being spent on future products when not enough was being done to sell the 400,000 Atari VCS's they already had. Ray wasn't a gamer. He wasn't there for the crash of 1977. He simply could not understand Bushnell's drive to build yet another system when they already had one.</p>
                    <p>But the disagreements went beyond different business strategies. Nolan saw Kassar as hopelessly out of touch, bureaucratic, and old fashioned. Kassar saw Bushnell as an unfocused, unprofessional hippie. </p>
                    <blockquote class="quote left-quote">
                        &ldquo;When I arrived there on the first day, I was dressed in a business suit and a tie and I met Nolan Bushnell. He had a T-shirt on. The T-shirt said: "I love to fuck." That was my introduction to Atari.&rdquo; &mdash; Ray Kassar
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>As 1978 wore on, Bushnell became more and more detached. "It wasn't as much fun playing with somebody else's money," he said. But he hadn't completely given up hope of saving the company he thought was doomed. After an explosive board meeting Bushnell attacked the Warner executives calling the VCS "shit" trying to abandon the under&mdash;performing, obsolete console rather than risk being taken down as so many companies had in 1977. Kassar couldn't just give up on the hundred million dollar investment. Gerrard sided with Kassar. Either Bushnell and Gerrard agreed to part ways, or he was simply fired. </p>
                    <p>Kassar was king now. </p>
                    <div class="year-empty" id="year-1979"></div>
                    <p>With Bushnell gone Kassar could focus on selling the VCS. Atari still had 400,000 of them sitting in warehouses. The system lacked a great game to drive console sales. No one had yet coined the term "killer app," but that's what Ray Kassar found for Atari when he bought the license for Space Invaders.</p>
                    <blockquote class="quote right-quote">
                        "I had come to the conclusion that a company that in my perception, was going to be screwed up long term was just something I didn't want to be associated with. I didn't see myself staying in a box." – Nolan Bushnell
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Space Invaders was a smash hit in arcades, the first blockbuster game. In Japan the game was so popular it was causing a coin shortage. And in America, it sat in every pizza parlor, laundromat, and arcade. Kassar saw the potential to leverage Space Invaders' popularity to sell VCS consoles. He licensed the game, the first such video game license. Even before Space Invaders came out, Atari realized the benefits of the newly invigorated video game market. The 400,000 VCS's sitting in warehouses finally sold during the Christmas shopping season of 1978. As soon as consoles came into retail stores, they went right out the door with customers. Like other future toy fads (Cabbage Patch Kids, Tickle Me Elmo, even the NES), news of supply shortages became its own a marketing campaign, much to the dismay of retailers who could not get restocked.</p>
                    <p>If Nolan Bushnell had held on for just a few months more he might have been present for the explosion of the VCS. He might have gotten credit for creating the fastest growing company in American history. As it happened, Ray Kassar would take the credit for bringing the war between little green men and us into our homes. That Bushnell left in 1978 was only validation to Warner that Atari could not succeed if the company maintained Bushnell's culture.</p>
                    <p>It took almost 2 years for Atari to release its home version of Space Invaders. In the future, Ray Kassar would reduce that development and manufacturing cycle to just a few months. This would be a mistake. Atari's VCS success had depended on a Japanese game. This was the first time that America's game industry would be dominated by the Japanese. In the years ahead, Atari would turn to Japanese licenses three more times, as Atari depended more and more on licenses, rather than in&mdash;house games.</p>
                    <p>The sale to Warner was a Mephistophelian deal. Under Kassar's and Gerrard's leadership Atari doubled in size every year. Had Atari been it's own company, not a subsidiary of Warner, it would have been a Fortune 500 company. But problems inside the company began to show as early as 1979 when the exodus of engineers began.</p>

                    <p>Before Warner, Atari had been a company of engineers who showed up to work at noon, worked all night, smoked weed in the warehouses, played games all day, and generally had no business chops. Warner executives walked into work in three piece suits promptly at eight in the morning, flew in corporate jets, and drank martinis with Hollywood stars. None of them played games.</p>
                    <p>Kassar observed that Atari was undisciplined. Atari employees complained that he attempted to graft Warner culture onto Atari. The open doors were locked with security passes. It would be very difficult for another Steve Jobs to steal parts for his prototypes. Kassar knew very little about engineering and engineers. To the press, Kassar called them "High Strung Prima Donnas." They responded by wearing t-shirts that read "Just another High Strung Prima Donna." Ray Kassar disagrees with the the accusations that he disrespected Atari engineers and wrecked the culture. "I really did all I could to encourage the programmers, to coddle them, to share the love, cheer them up, inspire them, you name it," Kassar said. "They were left alone, they did what they pleased. As long as they produced, it was fine by me."</p>
                    <p>Kassar seemed to have the final say on all projects, killing most of the innovation at R&amp;D. In the case of a holographic console, Cosmos, this was mercy killing. A holographic game console sounded neat to the press and attracted attention at the New York Toy Fair in 1981 and sold 8,000 units. But the reality was that the system was just some blinking LED's under a mylar hologram insert. Kassar recognized this Arnie Katz would say "Cosmos was an attempt to do tomorrow’s tech today. The holograms were only window dressing. The play action and the interest&mdash;level proved to be very low. It was a cosmetic advance and a game-play setback." Cosmos was another Al Alcorn project. He quit depriving Atari of another founder and engineer.</p>
                    <p>Roger Hector, another Cosmos engineer, was sent to Research and Development. R&amp;D was where the rebels were exiled. They had all the freedom they wanted, but none of their work made it into customers' hands. "We were playing a sort of game of being busy doing what we 'wanted,'" said Roger Hector. "But the cold reality of it was very little promise, if any, that anything we did would go anywhere." Alan Kay would set up a lab there which was home to Brenda Laurel, Jay Miner, Skip Paul, Scott Fisher, and others.</p>
                    <p>Kassar ignored his engineers' suggestions that the VCS was becoming obsolete. Mattel and Coleco both released competing systems that represented the next generation of gaming. Both attracted customers with add-ons which allowed Atari games to play on their systems – something unimaginable today. Eventually Kassar capitulated and asked his engineers to convert the Atari 400 computer into a gaming console. In 1982 Atari released the re-boxed Atari 400 as the Atari 5200. It was just short of a disaster. It had awful controls, a small library of games, and was not backwards compatible. For many engineers, it was time to go.</p>
                    <blockquote class="quote right-quote">"Those of us who stayed at Atari called ourselves the Dumb Shits Club. They made $50 million and we made $20,000." — Warren Robinett</blockquote>
                    <p>The culture change following the arrival of Warner was unwelcome, and the failure of management to innovate was frustrating. But what sent them packing was the lack of recognition for their designs. The engineers looked at sales figures and deduced that Atari was making tens of millions off of their games. David Crane, Larry Kaplan, Alan Miller, and Bob Whitehead were the first to approach Kassar asking for greater compensation and recognition. Kassar balked. Why should engineers get any special credit for making games when the guy on the assembly line had a hand in it too? After being rebuffed by Ray Kassar they left to form their own company that would design Atari games, Activision. Kassar didn't blink. Instead he sued Activision for making Atari games. Atari lost the suit, which opened the door to other third parties. First more engineers left to form Imagic. Then some engineers left to work at Atari's competitors: Coleco, Mattel, Apple, Commodore. With a shrinking staff many were quickly promoted and given raises, but management still refused to give designers credit in their games. Warren Robinett hid his name in the game Adventure as an act of rebellion creating the first video game "easter egg."</p>
                    <p>The brain drain was devastating for two reasons. First, those that stayed behind lacked the talent, skills, and creativity of those who had left. Second, it created an industry of third&mdash;party developers competing for the same customers. At first this seemed bad for Atari because they had pinned there business strategy on selling the system cheap and making money by selling all of the new games. Now there was competition.In the short term it helped the VCS by creating a larger pool of high quality products for consumers, but eventually the trickle of third party games became a flood, and Atari could do nothing to control the quality.</p>
                    <p>Warner couldn't even hold onto its own managers. There was a revolving door for VP's. Scott Cohen blames Kassar's "autocratic" management style – apparently he never let them make their own decisions. Warner just thought this was a consequence of rapid growth.</p>
                    <p>Kassar was non-plussed, after all, Atari still had its best years ahead.</p>

                    <p>Pac-Man wasn't <em>just<em> the hottest game of 1981, it was a cultural phenomenon. It was the Star Wars of the arcade and it spawned as many copy-cats and toys and dixie cups. It created a moral panic among parents and activists who thought video games were making their sons (and sometimes daughters) idle slackers, layabouts, and pixel addicts.</p>
                    <p>Obviously this was a game that Atari had to release for the home console and it was the second time they turned to Japanese game licenses. The arcade game had three times the processor speed, four times the storage, and sixteen times the memory of the 2600. Programmer Todd Frye used every tool in his box to convert the fast, smooth, exciting arcade action to the underpowered Atari VCS. The result of Frye's effort was a drab, flickering mess that resembled the arcade Pac-Man as much as a child's finger-painting might resemble a Rembrandt.</p>

                        It was amazing that they produced such a flickery, unresponsive game. And although they sold many copies, paradoxically the more copies they sold, the more people they turned off. – Arnie Katz
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Satisfied with the game, Kassar and Warner decided to manufacture 12 million copies of the game. By their own estimates there were only 10 million Atari 2600's in use, yet Atari was going to manufacture more games than there were systems. Kassar thought that the game's popularity might drive 2600 sales.  Instead, it drove consumers away. They recognized a cheap knock-off. Still Kassar framed it as a success: "It was a record. I mean, to ship 12 million of one product at a retail price of $25.75 was extraordinary." He didn't understand that shipping a game isn't the same as selling a game, until the started coming back unsold.</p>
                    <p>Coleco and Atari had entered into a feud over licenses that began with Donkey Kong. Coleco had licensed the game for home game consoles. Atari had licensed it for computers, but Coleco had attempted to release the game for their own console/computer crossover, the ADAM. Complicating the issue was a battle among Universal, Nintendo, Warner, Coleco, Tiger and RKO over rights to the Donkey Kong character. By the time the lawsuits were settled, Atari, Coleco, and the whole industry had already collapsed. During the battle Coleco realized it could force Atari to pay big for licenses because Atari was becoming more dependent on outside help as their own engineers left. According to Al Kahn, "Basically, we'd zap them. They had last right of refusal, so we'd just come up with a bid that was wild; then, of course, Atari would be forced to beat it."</p>
                    <blockquote class="quote right-quote">"...Atari dominated 80 percent of the video game market and assumed it would always be that way. But if Atari had looked more closely at what was going on, it would have had very good reason to believe things would change." – Scott Cohen</blockquote>
                    <p>Atari was also under assault in the arcades from enhancement boards, cheap add-ons that were an alternative to buying new and expensive game cabinets. One company, General Computer, had made a board for Pac-Man that would eventually become Ms. Pac-Man. General Computer had run afoul of Atari with an enhancement board for Missile Command. Atari's solution to the threat was to pay GC to not produce games by hiring them as Atari employees. GC Founder Doug Macrae thought they were being hired as designers: "Later, years later over beers, we were all laughing at the fact that the intent was to pay us $50,000 a month for two years to go away."</p>
                    <p>In spite of the competition, Atari was the keystone for the whole industry. In one way or another everyone depended on Atari. Warner depended on Atari's $500 million revenues. Activision, Imagic, and the other third parties depended on the Atari 2600 to sell their party games. The arcades depended on Atari coin-ops. Atari's new competitors, Coleco and Mattel, depended on the increasing obsolescence of the VCS to show off their own consoles' superiority.</p>
                    <p>In October 1981 Atari asked distributors to place their orders for the 1982 Christmas shopping season &mdash; more than a year in advance. Retailers, who remembered the shortages of Atari consoles and games in previous years, "ordered big." Everyone was betting Atari would be a Christmas Blockbuster for a fifth consecutive year. So Atari manufactured millions of cartridges to fill those orders. The games were as good as sold, especially with Ray Kassar's marketing skills behind them.</p>
                    <p>With major Hollywood licenses in their portfolio Atari was gearing up for what would be its biggest year yet.</p>

                    <p>Steve Ross was an elbow bumper, a name dropper. This was not an unearned reputation. Steven Spielberg and Barbara Streisand considered him a mentor and friend along. Ross had started in the car rental business and climbed the ladder to become CEO of Warner Communications in a decade. He was a visionary who had steered Warner through the big chill of the 1970's. Ross would go on to create Nickledeon and MTV and conquer at least part of the cable TV "airwaves."</p>
                    <p>But he knew nothing about video games. After playing Indy 800 with his kids at Disneyland he tried to bring a cabinet home with him, but it was too heavy to lift up the stairs. That was the extent of his video game expertise. He knew nothing about the video game business that accounted for 60% of his revenue.</p>
                    <blockquote class="quote left-quote">"E.T. was the beginning of the end. It was something we all were against. It wasn't just me. We were all against it. The programmers thought I was crazy. They said, 'We can't produce a game in two to three months! It's crazy.' So we rushed. It was a fiasco." – Ray Kassar</blockquote>
                    <p>With the novelty of the 2600 worn off and the 5200 stillborn, Atari needed another Pac-Man-sized hit to keep the competition at bay. Where it couldn't offer superior hardware it could make up for it with superior licenses. Steve Ross turned to his Hollywood connections and licensed the blockbuster <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> to transform into the next Atari 2600 hit. It seems like a safe bet to translate a blockbuster movie into a blockbuster game. Gamers, even today, will tell you that movie-to-pixel translations are doomed to fail, but no one knew that in 1982, especially not Steve Ross.</p>
                    <p>Designer Howard Scott Warshaw, who had created the instant classic Yar's Revenge, was asked to engineer Raiders. He was only given eight weeks to complete the task. He modeled Raiders on Warren Robinett's Adventure and it was good enough to meet with Steven Spielberg's approval. Raiders performed moderately well, but not nearly as well as its silver-screen counterpart.</p>
                    <p>Then Ross acquired the game license to Spielberg's <em>ET<em>, the highest grossing film in history, for a king's ransom of $25 million. Again, Ross was sure big box office receipts would translate into big home console sales. Ray Kassar disagreed. He recognized that <em>ET<em> wasn't an exciting, action–packed movie that would translate into a good game. If Kassar was good at anything at Atari, it was killing projects before they went to market, but Kassar couldn't stop his CEO from pushing ET forward. ET was going to be a $25 million disaster, and Kassar saw it coming. Kassar remembers that "[Ross] said, 'Well, you have to do it because I promised Spielberg we’d have it on retail shelves for Christmas.' We had literally six weeks to produce a brand new game, manufacture it, package it, and market it. It was a disaster. I mean, the programmers hated it. Nobody liked the game." Warshaw was hand-chosen by Speilberg to design and on Steve Ross's tight six week schedule. Ross ordered five million cartridges to be manufactured, not as many as had been manufactured of Pac-Man, but still far more than Kassar suggested. In the past two years, Ray Kassar had learned some lessons, but looking back, one gets the sense that Steve Ross had not.</p>
                    <p>Kassar would turn out to be right. In spite of ET's pedigree and HSW's maximum effort, the game was a confusing, impossible bore. Over the years it would be the stick by which all awful video games would be measured. Millions of copies went unsold even at discount prices. Orders were canceled. Shipments returned. The cartridges began to flow back to Atari.</p>

                    <p>On December 8, 1982, at the height of the Christmas shopping season, Atari reported lower than expected earnings. Much, much lower. The company had been telling analysts all year long that revenues were going to double as they had every year since the acquisition and that earnings per share were going to be about 5-and-a-quarter per share. Much of the hype was based on those pre-orders of Raiders and ET. But those games were not as popular as had been hoped. Revenues only went up 10% and earning of $3 per share, almost half of what Atari had promised. For a company and industry that had doubled every year since 1978, 10% growth was disappointing and a warning of a larger retraction.</p>
                    <p>The day of the announcement, VP of consumer electronics division, Perry Odak, was fired. Scott Cohen suspects that he was watching the returned cartridges pile up and silently hoping ET and Raiders would save the company's growth estimates. He warned nobody until it was far to late to fix the problem. His silence was unacceptable and he was let go. Atari's lack of confidence in their own managers must have frightened investors who were already angry about the inflated estimates they had been given because they began dumping stock. On December 9, Warner stock dropped 30% from 51 7/8 to 31 1/8. Overnight millions of dollars had evaporated. Atari unraveled.</p>
                    <p>Why were estimates so far off? Why had growth nearly halted? The company had so many problems it is hard to name a single smoking gun.</p>
                    <p>Starting in 1979, Commodore had been competing with Atari in the home computer market with the VIC-20. They had hoped to conquer the industry and destroy Jack Tramiel's rival Texas Instruments. Atari was caught in the middle of the fight. Not only did Commodore's sales cut into Atari's computer sales, but they also attracted gamers and parents eager to give their children a learning tool, not a video game console. Atari had brought Alan Kay in to create new computer products, and then did nothing with his team's work.</p>
                   <p>There were other event's outside of Atari's control that pushed them from the top of the mountain. In June of 1982 the arcade industry began a protracted decline that continues to this day. This may have been the first signal of the demise of the gaming fad in the eyes of investors and consumers. Third parties flooded the market with all manner of garbage and filth. From Purina Dog Chow's harmless "Chase The Chuck Wagon" to Mystique's deplorable celebration of sexual violence and genocide "Custer's Revenge" there were plenty of reasons for gamers to abandon the hobby and parents to protect their children and their wallets. Perhaps Atari was also a victim of inflation during the recession that crippled the arcades. Perhaps they were just losing ground to new cool things like VHS and Trivial Pursuit. People were just losing interest in this video game fad. Atari missed the these signals.</p>
                    <p>What about decisions made inside Atari? There was a lack of innovation because Warner bureaucracy ensured that the company moved slowly and few ideas made it to market. Without Bushnell's drive to innovate and without quality engineers, the company floundered. The key lesson of 1977, innovate to stay ahead of the next crash, had been forgotten. They overpaid for licenses to make up for the lack of innovation. Then Warner had publicly lost millions on licenses for ET and Raiders. That wasn't the only wasted money. There were corporate jets and martinis and impenetrable bureaucracy. They spent a lot of time and money on litigation which must have been a distraction to management and a drain on resources. Perry Odak can't be blamed for all of these mistakes.</p>
                    <p>What about Ray Kassar? Atari was his alone to run. He called the shots, he killed R&amp;D, he let engineers go. Maybe ignorance is his best defense. He simply didn't know when to move on to the next big thing soon enough. Still, hadn't Kassar been responsible for the success of the VCS in the first place? Kassar had stuck with the VCS when Bushnell wanted to give up. Atari made billions off of the VCS. It was Kassar who pulled Space Invaders out of coin-op and into home electronics. Kassar had been the one fighting Steve Ross on the ET license. He had been learning, just not fast enough to fill the pitfall he dug a year prior with the pre-orders.</p>
                    <blockquote class="quote right-quote">&ldquo;I think I’m responsible for some of the problem. I think Ray is responsible for a lot of the problem. Neither one of us is responsible for the fact that a market just went away in an eye blink.&rdquo; &mdash; Manny Gerrard</blockquote>
                    <p>There was no single business decision more damaging to the company's finances and image, than those October 1981 pre-sales. Atari had demanded that retailers buy their games and systems a full year in advance. If consumer demand met the number of products pre-ordered, Atari and retailers would win. If demand slowed, even just a little, retailers would start canceling their orders. That is exactly what happened. When consumer demand dropped in 1982, retailers canceled outstanding orders and shipped back unsold merchandise. Boxes began pouring back into Atari warehouses. Atari, like most toy manufacturers, bore all the risk of those canceled orders. They thought it was the only way to keep retailers buying. Loss of money aside, so many unsold games simply looked bad to retailers, consumers, and investors.</p>
                    <p>Atari would do their best to bury their blunders in a new Mexico landfill.</p>

                    <p>December 8th, 1982 was a busy day for Ray Kassar. In the morning he sold 5,000 shares of Warner stock for over $800,000. A few minutes later he made that disappointing earnings announcement. Then in the afternoon, he fired Perry Odak. The SEC suspected that he was unloading Warner stock before it crashed and they indicted him for insider trading. Kassar would argue that the sale wasn't an attempt to dump stock. Kassar visited the floor of Consumer Electronics unannounced only once it the past five years. It's likely he had no idea games were being returned. Perry Odak seemed to have pulled the wool over everyone's eyes. Ignorance may have been a defense against insider trading, but it was evidence of how out of touch he was with the company. Kassar would also argue that if he were he dumping the stock, he would have sold all of his shares, not just a few thousand. He settled with the SEC and paid fines equal to his profits: a mere $81,000.</p>
                    <blockquote class="quote left-quote">&ldquo;They tried to blame me for the E.T. fiasco. Somebody had to be the fall guy and it wasn't going to be Steve; he was the chairman of Warner. I was just chairman of one of their subsidiaries. So you know, somebody had to be the fall guy and it was me.&rdquo; &mdash; Ray Kassar</blockquote>
                    <p>Ray Kassar was fired. The man who turned a band of misfits and nerds into a billion dollar company which had a product in millions of American homes. He had saved Atari from ridiculous holographic game console and attempted to prevent the ET disaster. Had Atari succeeded in spite of or because of Ray Kassar? Had it failed in spite of or because of him?</p>
                    <p>Before Kassar left he had been talking with Nintendo to distribute their game system, the Famicom, in America. This was the third and final time Atari turned to Japan to save the company, but any deal Kassar had with Nintendo, if there ever was a serious deal, ended with Kassar's firing. Atari's deal with Nintendo is one of the biggest what if's in gaming history.</p>
                    <p>James Morgan a Philip Morris executive who also never played video games was brought in to turn the company around. He fired 6,500 employees, a two-thirds reduction. He moved manufacturing to Taiwan and reduced Atari's buildings from 49 to just 4. The cuts reduced operating expenses from $600 million to $150 million.</p>
                    <p>Morgan had Atari bury their unsold ET cartridges in a desert landfill in Almogordo, New Mexico. Then they buried everything else: consoles, cartridges, joysticks, accessories. They crushed the plastic and silicon pile and poured cement on top just to be sure. The symbolism of the burial was clear. Atari was digging a mass grave for the whole industry.</p>
                    <blockquote class="quote center-quote">&ldquo;Maybe anyone could have walked in there and accomplished as much as Ray Kassar did. Ray could have tripped on his way to work the first day, and by the time he was out of the hospital, all the sales could already have been happening. [But] If the world had stopped in mid-1982, Ray Kassar would have gone down in history as a genius, one of the shrewdest businessmen to come down the pike&hellip;&rdquo; &mdash; Scott Cohen</blockquote>
                    <p>Yet, Somehow the industry continued to grow in 1983 while Atari was collapsing, powered by the momentum of the past decade. Eventually Atari would bring everyone down with them. Third party developers, arcades, retailers, even their competition would crumble as their fortunes had been tied to those of Atari if not on paper bills, then in the minds of consumers. It was 1977 all over again. The fad was over. The North American Video Game Crash, as the industry retraction was later named, lasted almost three years.</p>
                    <p>Rupert Murdock attempted a hostile takeover of the struggling Warner in 1983. The damage done to Warner stock by Atari's fall was unacceptable. Warner had to stop the bleeding. They had to sell Atari.</p>

                    <p>No one wanted anything to do with video games in 1984. Not retailers, consumers, manufacturers, or investors. Atari wasn't the coolest thing anymore. Home video, Rubik's Cube, Trivial Pursuit, and Cabbage Patch Kids had replaced it.</p>
                    <p>With the video game industry in shambles, Warner put Atari up for sale. In July 1984 a former rival, Jack Tramiel, purchased Atari with what was essentially a loan from Warner &mdash; they just giving him the company. During the past five years, Tramiel had successfully pushed Texas Instruments out of the home computer industry, settling his vendetta with them. In the process he had been squeezing Atari out of the home computer industry. Now he had a new enemy: his own company, Commodore. Tramiel had been ousted from Commodore earlier that year, not because the business was failing under his leadership, but because he was so ruthless and autocratic. He had openly fought his own board, and they had had enough of him.</p>
                    <blockquote class="quote left-quote">&ldquo;I heard stuff was just flying out the doors and out the windows. If it wasn’t nailed down in the last couple of days there, people were walking out the door and stuffing it in their cars.&rdquo; &mdash; Steven Race</blockquote>
                    <p>Tramiel had no interest in Atari as a gaming company. He wanted their computers. First Tramiel split the company and Warner kept the coin-op division. Then Tramiel cut the workforce in half to 1,500 employees. It was now an eighth of the size it had been at its zenith. He put millions of unsold cartridges on sale for $2. This cemented the impression that Atari's games were inferior shovelware and fed the larger deflationary cycle in the industry. He gutted the gaming division. He killed the Atari's next generation console, the Atari 7800, a system developed by Atari's former enhancement board rivals, General Computing. He replaced managers and executives with allies from his Commodore days. Tramiel reincorporated the company as Atari Corporation. Tramiel's Atari was not the old Atari.</p>
                    <p>Under Tramiel&#8217;s leadership the company stabilized, but faded away. When the video game industry recovered in 1986 with the rise of Nintendo, Atari released the previously shelved 7800, but the games and the technology did not match up to the Nintendo Entertainment System. Atari attempted to enter the handheld video game market with the Atari Lynx, a full color 8-bit machine. It took six batteries which lasted only about three hours, not nearly enough for gamers. Once again the Nintendo system, the Game Boy, beat Atari. Then came the awful, underpowered Jaguar console in 1993. Atari continued producing 2600&#8217;s until 1992. The venerable little console born from Bushnell and raised by Kassar had lasted fifteen years and become an icon of the 1970&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s.</p>
                    <p>In the home computer market Tramiel was so focused on defeating Commodore that he failed to see Apple and IBM. Atari quit the home computer business in 1993. By 1995 Atari had no products. Tramiel sold Atari to a disk drive manufacturer.</p>

                    <p>Atari&#8217;s collapse was the catalyst for the Video Game Crash. When the crash finally subsided in 1986 a new generation of video game manufacturers and third parties tried to do everything differently from Atari. Nintendo, more than anyone else, provided an example for the anti-Atari business model. Nintendo restricted third party developers. They retained and rewarded their best designers, engineers, and managers. They eventually refused accept retailer's returns and cancellations and demanded timely payments. Atari became the industry's standard &ldquo;how-not-to-run-a-company&rdquo; example.</p>
                    <p>Today the Atari name appears on compilation disks, and Flashback consoles, t-shirts and mugs, but Atari is not Atari. It's just a name now &mdash; one of the most recognizable brands and logos in the world. The Atari name has been passed around from company to company seeking to cash in on nostalgia. As of 2014, Atari is a ten-person game studio.</p>
                    <p>Legends of the the burial in Almogordo grew in the three decades since 1983. The story became an urban legend, one that happened to be true and well documented. Yet people talked about it as if it were a myth. Proof of the legend's truth came on April 26, 2014 when two companies, Fuel Entertainment and LightBox Interactive, with a Kickstarter backing and corporate support from Microsoft, excavated the landfill. To no one's surprise, they found the buried ET cartridges. The exhumed remains of Atari are a testament to our nostalgia for the worst games and business decisions the industry has created.</p>
