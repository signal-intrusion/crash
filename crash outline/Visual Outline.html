Atari: The company who started the video game industry and the company who caused it's collapse.
<div><br/></div>
<div>Cinematronics: Represents some of the most corrupt and lazy business practices. Began the vector games and laserdisc games fad, but still collapsed.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Activision: Atari rebels that nearly got taken down in spite of making quality games. Eventually renamed themselves Mediagenic. Would be brought back to life by Nintendo console.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Bally: Pinball &amp; casino game makers, buy Midway after Space invaders success. Pac Man, Ms. Pac Man. Survived by diversifying into hesalth clubs.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Nintendo: The sleeping dragont. Released Famicom in 1983, then NES in 1985. At one point caused a fight between Coleco &amp; Atari leading to many lawsuits. Had secret weapon: Miyamoto.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Quaker Oats/ US Games: Desperate attempt to cash in 1982. Left business in 1983, less than a year later. Created "Name This Game" contest</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Twin Galaxies Arcade: Most famous Arcade in world in 1984. Hosts the famous life magazine photo. Closes in 1985. Arcades took a huge hit in 1983 and never really recovered.</div>

<h1>Outline of Causes</h1>
</td>

</table>
1) Lack of quality home game ports and originals. Atari Pac Man and ET are most often cited as emblematic of the poor quality of games in 1982. 
<div><br/>
<div>2) Too much supply, too many consoles. Overstocks caused the now famous Atari landfills. This really hurt smaller companies like Activision who, while they produced quality games, were far more expensive than the bargain bin ones.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>3) Economics: Peak of recession was Nov-Dec 1982, S&amp;L crisis, high interest rates, high inflation, high unemployment. 1982 Cristmas shopping season was very poor for video games.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>4) Lack of innovation, lack of novelty. Een at arcades. Dragon's Lair was popular for short period of time. Purchase of conversion kits was very large, but not so many new games.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5) LAWSUITS: rarely mentioned but by this time there were numerous long lasting lawsuits between manufacturers: Magnavox v Atari, Coleco v. Atari, Cinematronics v Vectorbeam. Fighting over characters, licenses, patents, games, and so on.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6) Bans &amp; Moral Panics. Games seen as violent, expensive, and distracting. Many municipalities banned arcades. By the time the arcades won 1st amendment cases against bans it was too late.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>7) Explosion of third parties. Started by Activision. Too many publishers making too many low quality games. Related to #2. This was, in a sense, a consequence of the crash of 1977.</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>8) Competition from home computers esp. Commodore &amp; Apple.</div>
