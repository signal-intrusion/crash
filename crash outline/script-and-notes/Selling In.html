I got a phone call from one of our large institutional investors… He said something like 'Would you be interested in a technology based entertainment company?' The words sounded right so I said 'yes.' I didn't know what I was saying yes to but the description fitted us. The next thing I know I'm going to Los Gatos, California and I'm taken to this company called Atari… I wrote an internal memo saying, 'I have seen the future and it is called Stella.'"

"Everybody was losing interest in the digital watch and the pocket calculator and most of the people we went to wondered why video games would be any different. Warner Communications was the only one with guts to put over $100 million into the company while everybody else was saying it was another CB radio." Nolan Bushnel<br/></div>

<div>"Warner's biggest division, records and music publishing, had been red hot since the beginning of the early seventies, when pop music reached its pinnacle. Warner had superstar artists like Fleetwood Mac, Rod Stewart, Neil Young, Van Morrison, Randy Newman, and the Beach Boys; but by the mid-seventies record sales took a dip. Suddenly Warner realized it wouldn't continue selling ten million Fleetwood Mac albums forever… In 1976 people, especially kids, were ready for another form of entertainment. Music didn't have the meaning it had had in the late sixties and early seventies, when it was the main form of expression, and this left the door wide open for video games. Cash-rich Warner was desperate for a hot new product, and product-rich Atari was desperate for cash." Cohen</div>

<div>"Nolan Bushnell can look you in the eye when he says he was twenty-nine years old when he started Atari with $250 of his own money and in four years had sold the company for $28 million, of which $15 million went into his pocket." Cohen</div>

<div>"Gerard and I got along famously at first. I still like Manny to this day, as an individual. But there's a difference between liking somebody and thinking he's a great businessman. In business we always had a problem, in approach and philosophy. We would have tremendous arguments but always with smiles on our faces. I told Manny to go to hell many times, but it didn't mean we didn't like each other. Where we became unglued was when Manny started killing the research projects. I saw that as building a very fragile company. Manny wouldn't commit himself as far as I thought he should. Manny is an entertainment analyst; he didn't fully grasp the diversity of engineering. He thought a hundred million dollars in one project made a lot more sense than a million dollars here and a million dollars there." Bushnell</div>

<div>"Steve Ross had just gone to Disneyland with his kids. They went into an arcade and all they played was Indy 800, and they were really fascinated with the game. One of the reasons this transaction occurred was because Ross understood the power of this game. He’d seen it at Disneyland.</div>
<div>Actually, he really wanted an Indy 800 game for his apartment, but it ended up that we couldn’t get it in. It was too heavy."</div>

<div>The biggest problem with the company was that you had a bunch of babies—not literally, not as a character flaw. These were young guys. If they made too much money, I didn’t know how we could motivate them. We couldn’t give them too much money because they’d go live under a tree somewhere.</div>
<div>Basically, they got a teeny bit of cash and the debentures of the subsidiary, which were not secured by the parent. We took the outside investors out for cash, but the insiders had to take these debentures.</div>

<div>Years after selling Atari, Bushnell confessed that selling the company might have been a mistake. The roller-coaster ride of meeting each month’s payroll had left him exhausted, and the idea of raising the capital needed to produce the Video Computer System overwhelmed him at the time. “I’ve often thought that if I had taken a two-week vacation and really rested and got away from the whole thing, I never would have sold the company.”
<div>According to Gerard, Bushnell seemed elated at the signing. “The day we signed the papers to close the deal, Nolan’s comment was, ‘I’ve been telling people I’m a millionaire for years, and at last I am.’”</div>
