<div>Atari witnessed their market share and revenues shrink throughout 1975-6 as the other companies entered the arcade and home game business.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Bushnell, always the entrepreneur, knew Atari had to pivot and create an affordable cartridge-based home console of their own or perish in the approaching collapse. He understood that the novelty which was driving Pong sales was worn out. Up to this point home game systems could only play a number of built in games. Even the cartridges for the Odyssey wet just jump switches to change between built-in in games – a switch would have changed just as well. So Atari hired some very talented engineers and started work on Stella, later named the VCS, later named 2600.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>But Atari had little money to manufacture the system, let alone even finish the engineering and design. Atari had to get capital fast, Pong was over. Worse, Fairchild Semiconductor had released a programmable home system called the Channel F. The $170 Fairchild Channel F could play an unlimited number of games programmed on interchangeable cartridges. Atari was going to be left behind.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>They had a two choices: go public or sell themselves. They chose the latter.</div>

"Channel F was competitively priced at $170. It made Atari's black and white dedicated game, which played only Pong, look as obsolete as a Brownie box camera compared to a Polaroid."<br/>

"One of Atari's weaknesses was it was primarily self-financed… Most of the money it made came from selling products, which it then spent making the next product. There was'n a pool of capital. There were times when it was practically cheque-to-cheque and there would be a race out of the parking lot to make sure your pay cheque would be cashed." Steve Bristow</div>
