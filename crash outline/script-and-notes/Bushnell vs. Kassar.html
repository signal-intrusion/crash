<div>In 1977 as the home video game market collapsed, Atari struggled to sell its VCS. 400,000 units had been manufactured and after the christmas shopping season most of them remained in Atari warehouses (Cohen, Kent). Manny Gerrard hired Ray Kassar to turn things around at Atari in February of 1978. Kassar had a marketing background in the textile industry and Gerrard figured a hard boiled, East Coast, sales man  in a three piece suit could whip Atari into shape and find a way to sell those VCS consoles. Kassar started by simply switching to a year-round marketing and sales effort instead of just Christmas, but that did little to motivate buyers.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Kassar streamlined operations and cut R&amp;D. He didn't understand why all this money was being spent on future products when not enough was being done to sell the 400,000 Atari VCS's they already had. Ray wasn't a gamer. He wasn't there for the crash of 1977.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Atari had two kings now. Bushnell did not put up a fight for the throne. Before the end of the year he and co-founder Joe Keenan would leave Atari. and Ray Kassar would become President and CEO.</div>

"Ray wore three-piece tailored suits, white shirts, and cufflinks. His tie had a perfect knot. He wore tinted glasses like Henry Kissinger. He didn't take a vacation for five years, worked weekends, and was at the office by 7:30 A.M., and didn't leave until after six. Nolan popped into the office, usually not until afternoon, dressed as if he had just stepped off the tennis court, which he usually had. Nolan believes that hard work doesn't necessarily lead to good results. Good results are a combination of work and fun. Kassar was a conservative, disciplined bottomliner, the exact opposite of Nolan, who was as impulsive as Francis Ford Coppola when it came to going over budget. One of them had to go."

<div>"After we sold the company," said Joe Keenan, who remained as president of Atari and who was also made a multimillionaire by the Warner deal, "we didn't feel like busting our ass." Nolan shrugged, saying it wasn't as much fun playing with somebody else's money. Meanwhile Atari had $40 million tied up in inventory. Gerard started putting pressure on Nolan to find somebody who could manage the situation.</div>

<div>NOLAN BUSHNELL: <em>When I got back to California I read my contract. One clause stated that if I was fired I'd receive $100,000 a year for four years, but if I quit I'd get nothing. That's why I wasn't showing up to work for a year and a half. I was forcing their hand, I had come to the conclusion that a company that in my perception, was going to be screwed up long term was just something I didn't want to be associated with. I didn't see myself staying in a box. I always said I could make more money doing entrepreneurial things than working for somebody else. I called up Manny and told him I wasn't going to give up my position as CEO. I don't think there was any emergency meeting. I told him that he should exercise his right in the employment contract--I think it was Clause 1.1, which was their escape clause. Manny said "Okay," and fired me. BUSHNELL</em></div>

<div>Years after selling Atari, Bushnell confessed that selling the company might have been a mistake. The roller-coaster ride of meeting each month’s payroll had left him exhausted, and the idea of raising the capital needed to produce the Video Computer System overwhelmed him at the time. “I’ve often thought that if I had taken a two-week vacation and really rested and got away from the whole thing, I never would have sold the company.”</div>
<div>According to Gerard, Bushnell seemed elated at the signing. “The day we signed the papers to close the deal, Nolan’s comment was, ‘I’ve been telling people I’m a millionaire for years, and at last I am.’” KASSAR</div>

<div>Anyway, I arrived at this so-called management committee meeting and there were about six or seven of them drinking beer and smoking marijuana.</div>
<div>They offered me a joint.</div>
<div>I said, “No, I don’t do drugs.”</div>
<div>And Nolan said, “Well, why don’t you just relax? We’re just kind of … ”</div>
<div>I said, “Look, are you having a meeting? If you’re having a meeting, I’ll stay. If you’re not, I’m leaving.”</div>
<div>He said, “No, we’re just going to drink some beer and wine.” So I left. -Kassar</div>

<div>The ultimate parting with Nolan came at the budget meeting of Warner in 1978. Nolan came to the meeting, got up at the meeting, and everybody sat there in stunned amazement as Nolan said, “Sell off your remaining inventory of 2600s. [2600 was another name for VCS.] You’ve saturated the market. The market is saturated at the top. It’s over.”</div>
<div>Remember, there were a lot of Warner people who didn’t know nothing about nothing. And nobody in the room could figure what the hell Nolan was talking about. -Gerard</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>There was this whole thing in which it came to my attention that Nolan was trying to call a board meeting with Joe [Keenan], and they said something about didn’t I get my notice? I said to myself, this is untenable, then I got the contracts out, I got the lawyers out, and I removed Nolan from office.</div>
<div>Nolan was simply removed and he was put on the beach. Okay?</div>
<div>Then Joe asked to be put on the beach. That’s a … word of ours, because by putting him on the beach, he was entitled to certain modest compensation in some bonus pool arrangements.</div>
<div>I don’t remember the numbers, but Nolan and Joe got 1 percent of this bonus pool, which, at that moment in time, he [Bushnell] believed was valueless. I believe what was going on was that they perceived they could make a fortune with Chuck E. Cheese, and who gave a shit about Atari anyway? - Gerrard</div>

<div><i>Manny told me you were hired to try and bring some much-needed management discipline to Atari. How in need of proper management was the company at the time you joined?</i>
<div><br/></div>
<div>RK: The company had no infrastructure. There was no chief financial officer; there was no manufacturing person, no human resources. There was nothing. The company was totally dysfunctional.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><i>Did you know it was that bad when you agreed to go in?</i></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>RK: No. I had no idea.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><i>Must have been a bit of a shock, then...</i></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>RK: That's to say the least. To give you an example, when I arrived there on the first day, I was dressed in a business suit and a tie and I met Nolan Bushnell. He had a T-shirt on. The T-shirt said: "I love to fuck." That was my introduction to Atari.</div>

<div><i>One of the legends about Atari is that Nolan Bushnell offered you a cannabis joint at a management meeting shortly after you joined the company. What was your reaction to that, and how did you deal with the wider culture of drug use at Atari?</i></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>RK: Yes, this is true. I told Bushnell that I was busy. I got up and left the meeting... It was unbelievable. Dealing with the drug problem was an ongoing challenge. You know, we did the best we could, but it was a tough problem: we had 12,000 people at one point.
<div><br/></div>
<div><i>Do you think it was a problem particular to Atari?</i></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>RK: No, no. It was California: everybody smoked pot. It was not an endemic problem, it didn't -- in my opinion -- affect anybody's work. But it was a bit of a problem and every company had that problem.</div>
