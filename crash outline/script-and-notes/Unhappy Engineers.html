"Whenever the men in shirts and ties from Sears dropped by Atari, the technicians hid in the back room, for fear of alienating them. Bob Brown, an engineering supervisor at Atari, had just designed Video Music, a game that hooked up to the TV set and the stereo so that the sound from the stereo produced psychedelic visuals on the TV screen. It was Atari's most off-the-wall product. The men from Sears asked what they were smoking when they designed it, and one of the technicians stepped out from the back room and produced a lit joint."
