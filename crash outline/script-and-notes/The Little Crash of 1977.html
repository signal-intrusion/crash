<div>In 1977 the sixty or seventy companies that were manufacturing two-hundred or more home video game consoles ceased production, dropped out of the business, or went bankrupt. A year earlier the home console industry had made $150 million in profits on sales of 3.5 million consoles, a ten-fold increase over 1975. But in 1977, profits vanished. The primary culprit of the boom and the bust was a microchip, AY-3-8500 which had allowed manufacturers to cheaply manufacture Pong clones. Within two years of the chip's 1975 release the market was saturated with so many cheap clones that it collapsed.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A few companies lingered: Bally, Magnavox, Coleco. In Japan, Nintendo was just getting started building Pong consoles and in America Atari had a implemented a plan for survival called "Stella."</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The Little Crash of of 1977 had forced Atari to go all-in on their programmable console. It also encouraged them to take steps to avoid falling victim to the next crash. First they sold the Atari console with a narrow profit margin in order to realize a greater margin on games. Second they allowed third party manufacturers to make cartridges for the system in an effort to avoid stagnation and increase differentiation. Third they made a serious effort to innovate and stay on top of emerging technologies.</div>

<div>"A brief, cautionary word. Despite the variety of electronic games available, some industry observers are convinced the future lies not with limited option dedicated games, but with programmable systems that can be expanded indefinitely. Only Fairchild has such a game on the market today, but others are near. It may pay to wait. RCA, for example, will have its “Studio II” ready by mid-year. It promises five built-in games with three cartridges available initially and others to follow.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A programmable video unit, with its ability to create virtually any imaginable kind of visual display, has the potential to offer much more than just entertainment. It could be the first step toward a true home computer, useful as an instructional tool and as an information storage and retrieval device. As these applications are refined, the price of new program cartridges should drop, perhaps by as much as 50 per cent.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>All this, of course, still is some time away. Meanwhile, there are plenty of electronic games with which to occupy our leisure time. Television anyone?"</div>

<div>"The sale of home TV electronic games peaked during the Christmas season of 1976, followed by a severe decline in 1977. Was the estimated 3-million video games sold in ’76 just a passing fancy of the American public? Obviously not, since manufacturers are now producing with the expectation that 1977 sales will easily be twice those of 1976. And nonvideo electronic games will certainly make their mark this year, too. Home TV games did not move as well as anticipated during the first half of ’77 for a variety of reasons: (1) Christmas doesn’t last all year (though interest in games should be year-round); (2) reduced selling prices on games disheartened many retailers, who placed them on the back shelves; (3) programmable games are just around the corner. Concerning the latter, there are two companies already marketing them— Fairchild, who can’t seem to keep up with consumer demands at $170 a game [system] plus “cartridges,” and RCA, just really entering the market with a $150 programmable model."</div>

<div>"Although the crash of 1977 had less of an impact than the Great Crash of 1983, it provided a warning and demonstrated how unbridled enthusiasm within the industry would not necessarily be followed by consumers, who were becoming more careful and looking ahead to what technology was on the horizon, rather than adopting every new system and advance as it appeared. Continuing miniaturization and the rapidly dropping prices"</div>

<div>The boom and bust of 1977 closely mirrored the pocket calculator crash two years prior. As chips became cheaper to manufacture and more competitors entered the market prices of calculators dropped from $400 in 1970 in $40 in 1975.<br/>

<div>"The steady and abundant stream of TV games will slowly diminish. Right now, large runs are confined to only the best games. It is even becoming difficult to sell the TV game that is just good or marginal. And this trend is irreversible. The number of manufacturers will decrease – and so will the number go new games. But we will enter a new generation of TV or similar games. They will inevitably stimulate renewed interest, enthusiasm, and earnings."</div>

<div>"Despite the shortage of TV games during the Christmas 1976 season, the market collapsed in 1977. Allied Leisure went bankrupt before it could deliver its backgammon games. National Semiconductor stopped development of its improved version of Adversary; Magnavox cancelled its top-ofthe-line 24-game system. Atari, thanks to a fresh infusion of money by Warner Communication, hung in. So did Coleco, somehow surviving losses of $30 million for 1977. One by one, most of the video game manufacturers dropped out. The casualties included the three semiconductor companies who were building games with their own chips: Fairchild, National Semiconductor, and RCA."

<div>In "Down Many Times, but Still Playing the Game" Mirko Ernkvist describes three key factors in video game industry crashes:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>1) Disruptive technologies</div>
<div>2) Delimited differentiation</div>
<div>3) Decreased entry barriers and destructive liabilities of newness and smallness</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>In 1977 these factors were:</div>
<div>1) Introduction of programmable systems like the RCA STudio II and Fairchild Channel F, handled systems for Mattel and Texas Instruments. Home computers such as Commodore PET, Apple II and Tandy.</div>
<div>2) All dedicated consoles were variations of Pong or Tanks. the only difference was appearance and name.</div>
<div>3) AY-3-8500 Allowed many companies to enter the market producing cheap dedicated pong consoles.</div>
