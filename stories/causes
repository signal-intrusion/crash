Causes of the Crash

1) Lack of quality home game ports and originals. Atari Pac Man and ET are most often cited as emblematic of the poor quality of games in 1982.

2) Too much supply, too many consoles. Overstocks caused the now famous Atari landfills. This really hurt smaller companies like Activision who, while they produced quality games, were far more expensive than the bargain bin ones.

3) Economics: Peak of recession was Nov-Dec 1982, S&L crisis, high interest rates, high inflation, high unemployment. 1982 Cristmas shopping season was very poor for video games.

4) Lack of innovation, lack of novelty. Een at arcades. Dragon's Lair was popular for short period of time. Purchase of conversion kits was very large, but not so many new games.

5) Lawsuits: rarely mentioned but by this time there were numerous long lasting lawsuits between manufacturers: Magnavox v Atari, Coleco v. Atari, Cinematronics v Vectorbeam. Fighting over characters, licenses, patents, games, and so on.

6) Bans & Moral Panics. Games seen as violent, expensive, and distracting. Many municipalities banned arcades. By the time the arcades won 1st amendment cases against bans it was too late.

7) Explosion of third parties. Started by Activision. Too many publishers making too many low quality games. Related to #2. This was, in a sense, a consequence of the crash of 1977.

8) Competition from home computers esp. Commodore & Apple.

9) Waste, Fraud & Corruption. Atari is hugely wasteful and managers charged with insider trading. Cinematronics is very corrupt and lazy in its dealings.

10) No sustainable business models established. Matel loses millions by selling it's console at a loss. Atari has no product cycle to speak of. Atari manufactures too many games and pays too much for licenses.



Consequences of the Crash

    Best shown with story of Nintendo

6) Nintendo places tight controls on third parties and quality controls
